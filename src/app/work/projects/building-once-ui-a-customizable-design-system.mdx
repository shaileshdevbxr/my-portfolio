## Overview

Developed Beauty.ai, an AI-driven beauty platform that provides personalized skincare and beauty product recommendations based on user preferences and AI analysis.

## Key Features

AI-Powered Recommendations: Integrated machine learning models to analyze user data and provide personalized beauty and skincare suggestions.
User Authentication & Profiles: Implemented secure authentication with OAuth and JWT, allowing users to create profiles and save preferences.
Scalable Backend Architecture: Built a robust API using Node.js and Express, connected to PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Optimized Performance: Leveraged Next.js for fast, server-side rendering and static generation, improving SEO and user experience.
Responsive UI/UX: Designed and developed an intuitive front-end using React.js and Tailwind CSS to ensure accessibility and seamless interactions.

Challenges and Learnings
One of the key challenges was optimizing AI processing while maintaining a seamless user experience. To solve this, server-side AI computations were implemented with caching mechanisms, significantly improving response times. Additionally, designing a scalable database schema was crucial to handling increasing user data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

Next.js: For fast, server-side rendering and SEO optimization.
React.js & Tailwind CSS: For building a modern, responsive user interface.
Node.js & Express: For handling API requests and backend logic.
PostgreSQL: For storing and managing user data efficiently.
TensorFlow.js: For integrating AI-powered beauty recommendations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.


## Outcome
Beauty.ai now provides an intelligent, user-friendly platform that helps users discover the best beauty products tailored to their needs. The AI-driven recommendation system enhances personalization, while the scalable architecture ensures long-term sustainability and performance. The project has significantly improved engagement and user satisfaction.
